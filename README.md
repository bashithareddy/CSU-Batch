Description:

First group project for Software Engineering class, a batch scheduling system called CSUbatch that uses the Python programming language. 

Goal of the Project:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a batch scheduling system called CSUbatch using the Python programming language. First we created two threads a parent a child process. The synchronization of these two threads must be implemented by condition variables. To address the synchronization issues in CSUbatch, you may envision the scheduling and dispatching modules as a producer and a consumer, respectively. In addition to condition variables, mutex must be adopted to solve the critical section problem in CSUbatch.
